# Shanti

OpenBangla Keyboard Shanti is a Linux-focused fork of [OpenBangla Keyboard](https://github.com/OpenBangla/OpenBangla-Keyboard). The project focuses on a dependable user-local installation, package integrity, and compatibility with modern atomic Linux systems.

**Project status:** Highly Experimental · Vibe-Coded

## Scope

The primary target systems are Bluefin/Dakota, Bazzite, and similar modern atomic Linux distributions. Other Linux desktops may work, but compatibility should be treated as unverified unless supported by a documented test.

The current distribution approach is a portable, user-local installation. Work on alternative package formats must not disrupt that path. Flatpak is being investigated as an optional distribution format; it is not the project's main objective and is not a replacement decision.

## Project priorities

1. **Installation and removal:** predictable user-local setup and clean uninstallation, without unnecessary changes to the base operating system.
2. **Integrity:** validate package archives and downloads; verify provenance where available.
3. **Input-method integration:** keep Bengali typing working through the relevant host input-method framework.
4. **Maintainability:** reproducible build and packaging steps, automated checks, and actionable troubleshooting documentation.
5. **Distribution choices:** retain the portable installer and evaluate additional formats only where their practical value and integration costs are understood.

## Documentation

### Installation and support

- [Installation](Installation.md) — installation methods and prerequisites.
- [Uninstallation](Uninstallation.md) — removing Shanti and its user-local integration.
- [Input Methods](Input-Methods.md) — IBus/Fcitx5 selection and integration notes.
- [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md) — known issues and diagnostic steps.

### Implementation and contribution

- [Architecture](Architecture.md) — project components and runtime layout.
- [Development](Development.md) — build and development workflow.
- [Project Checklist](../PROJECT-CHECKLIST.md) — tracked project work.

### Packaging and distribution

- [Flatpak Distribution Experiment](Flatpak-Experiment.md) — feasibility plan, stages, and acceptance criteria. This is an experiment only; no Flatpak implementation is currently claimed by this page.

## Development principles

- Keep installation and removal steps explicit and scoped to the user's installation.
- Prefer reproducible builds and verifiable release artifacts.
- Do not assume that success on one desktop proves compatibility with another.
- Test Bengali typing in host applications; a GUI launch alone is not an input-method integration test.
- Request no broader filesystem or session permissions than the implementation demonstrably requires.
- Distinguish verified behaviour from assumptions and unresolved issues.
