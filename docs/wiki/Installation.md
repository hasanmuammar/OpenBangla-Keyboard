# Installation — OpenBangla Keyboard for Linux

The normal installer uses prebuilt Linux releases. It does not require a compiler, CMake, Rust, Qt development packages, or a build container.

Supported architectures:

- x86_64
- ARM64 (aarch64)

KDE Plasma automatically selects Fcitx5. Other desktop environments select IBus.

## Install

Clone this fork and run the prebuilt installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasanmuammar/OpenBangla-Keyboard-Shanti.git
cd OpenBangla-Keyboard-Shanti
bash tools/install.sh
```

The installer needs Bash, Python 3, GNU tar, `sha256sum`, `realpath`, `find`, `mktemp`, and either `curl` or `wget`. It installs for the current user and does not require compiler, CMake, Rust, Qt development packages, or a build container.

The installer uses the release tag in `release-tag.txt`. To select a different published release:

```bash
bash tools/install.sh --version TAG
```

Replace `TAG` with an actual published Shanti release tag. The installer downloads the archive and its SHA-256 checksum, validates that the checksum names the expected archive and contains exactly one digest, and compares the digest with the downloaded bytes. It also rejects archive paths outside the expected `bin/`, `lib/`, `libexec/`, and `share/` trees, duplicate archive paths, absolute symbolic links, and extracted symbolic links that escape the staging directory. Installation only proceeds after the staged payload passes backend-specific completeness checks.

**Checksum limitation:** the checksum is published alongside the archive, so SHA-256 detects corruption or a mismatched file but does not independently authenticate the publisher if both assets are replaced.

## Verify signed release provenance

New releases are configured to publish GitHub/Sigstore build-provenance attestations for the archive and checksum. To require attestation verification before installing:

```bash
bash tools/install.sh --version TAG --verify-provenance
```

This option requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`), a versioned release tag, and online access to GitHub. Verification is restricted to this repository's release workflow and the selected tag; installation stops if verification fails. It is optional so the normal installer does not gain a mandatory GitHub CLI dependency.

Attestations are only available for releases produced by a workflow version that includes the attestation step. Previously published releases are not retroactively attested.

## Build from source

Source compilation is a separate developer workflow:

```bash
bash tools/build.sh
```

The source build can use Toolbx, Distrobox, Podman, or Docker to isolate development dependencies. Release builds are produced for both x86_64 and ARM64.

## IBus

On GNOME and other non-KDE/Plasma desktops, the installer installs the IBus engine, registers the component under `XDG_DATA_HOME/ibus/component`, rebuilds the IBus cache, and persists the user-local `IBUS_COMPONENT_PATH`.

Verify registration with:

```bash
ibus list-engine | grep -i -A3 -B2 openbangla
```

## Fcitx5

On KDE/Plasma, the installer selects the Fcitx5 backend and installs its module and addon metadata under the user-local prefix.
